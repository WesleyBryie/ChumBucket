***Rule 3 may sound counter-intuitive given that this is a piracy oriented subreddit, but we had to take these measures to [prevent our subreddit from being banned by the reddit admins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/subfaq)***

To clarify upon rule 3...

> ***YOU CAN:***

> * Ask where to find general content, eg., "Where can i download electronic music?", "what is a good streaming site?", "what is a good website for audiobooks?", "where can i find cracked android apps?".

> * Name/link a website as a response to someone's ***general request***

> ***YOU CANNOT:***

> * Request for specific content (this is not a request subreddit), eg. a specific movie title, specific book, specific software, song by a specific artist, etc.

> * Name/link a website as a response to someone's ***specific title request***, or even name a warez release name (eg. Title.Of.The.Movie.YEAR.Source.Codec-GROUP), or offer to PM them.
