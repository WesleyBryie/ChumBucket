Avoid the pirate bay, it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. [Skulled users are not trustworthy either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

 * [rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/) (torrents) [.org, .net, .nl] - Amazing tracker for software (ie. your most desired graphics/music/video software, including plugins for them, etc.). Torrents will be checked by staff for integrity and will show a checkmark on the torrent page. 
 * [rarbg.to](https://rarbg.to/) - Allows no user uploads. Everything is automated to auto post scene releases, either through a combination of close ties to The Scene or simply re-uploads content from general/0-day private trackers, who themselves have close ties to The Scene. In either situation, it's one of the safer public trackers for software and games.
 * [warez-bb.org](http://warez-bb.org/) (DDL) - This one is especially good for PC software. The site is down most of the time though, sadly. Has the highest number of cracked software than any other resource. For larger torrents though, it is recommended to use MOCH (multi one-click hosters) like real-debrid, or you can try the torrents first while keeping the DDL alternatives as a last resort.
