**Notes on software and sites to avoid:**

* Try to avoid the pirate bay if you can (for software/games), it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. [Skulled users are not trustworthy either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

  * If you are going to use the pirate bay, never use it for software, but otherwise you'll want to take preliminary steps to avoid malware when browsing for other types of media (video, audio, etc.). [Guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide)

* uTorrent [has bundled malware (a bitcoin miner) into the software in the past](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). The company developing this software is not trustworthy. Bittorrent (the torrent client) is owned by the same company.

* [Bitlord \(torrent client\) is malware.](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1yb8kf/warning_do_not_download_bitlord_it_has_major/)

* [Soda Stream is malware.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/8q2pg3/anyone_who_can_explain_why_soda_player_is/)

* [Sidify/Allavsoft are scams - They are not able to download from spotify in any way, and instead record the streams or download from alternative platforms, like youtube.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/6l2lwh/any_experience_with_sidify/)

* Peerblock is garbage and placebo software. If you were to assume that their IP block lists are accurate, it still would not help to curb copyright complaints against you. Other peers in the swarm do not need to be connected to you in order to see your IP. Your IP will be visible regardless and if found in a torrent swarm, it's liable to be logged and reported.

#### **Premium Links from file hosts**

Some DDL sites may only offer downloads through premium links, meaning the download will be available through a file host which would lock the download unless you paid a subscription to said file host. The prices can be a bit extravagant, especially when you consider that many DDL sites may use different file hosts, so it would not be feasible to pay for multiple of these subscriptions.

To get around this, you can try [free premium leech generators](https://filehostlist.miraheze.org/wiki/Free_Premium_Leeches) or pay for a debrid service, such as real debrid, premiumize, all debrid, etc. which supports downloading from a large list of file hosts, torrents, etc. as an alternative. They essentially act as a middleman, meaning they download the file for you (an automated process), then you download from them. Services like these can be as cheap as 3 USD a month, which can be considered a good tradeoff given the large amount of file hosts they offer downloading from, compared to file host subscription each costing upwards of 10 USD a month.
