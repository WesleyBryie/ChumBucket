# PRIVACY AND SECURITY

As a precursor, read our entry regarding copyright infringement complaints: ["Will I get in trouble for downloading this? How does my ISP know what I download? -- All about copyright infringement complaints and what to do if you've received one and preventing further notices."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/isp_complaints)

### ► **VPNs** 

* Popular VPN services aggressively market themselves on Reddit. Do not subscribe to a service just because Reddit deems it popular, cheap, or because it hits the front page. You are entrusting an entity with your personal data; do your own research. Keep in mind that VPN experiences are completely anecdotal. Someone's experience with a particular VPN may vary from location, servers, operating systems, downloads speeds, etc...

* With that said, below are some resources with which you may begin your research. Most if not all popular VPNs offer trials and/or immediate refunds. Use them to your advantage in your quest to find a VPN that works best for you. Don't forget to also read their ToS!

* Beware of free VPNs if you plan on using one for online purchases or to log into websites with sensitive data. Many free VPNs are able to provide their free services because they data mine, interpose ads in searches, etc... 

* Beware of pirating VPNs. You wouldn't pirate a condom?

* [An alternative to purchasing your VPN is hosting your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/search?q=vps&restrict_sr=on). You will have much more flexibility and you can have your VPS hoster outside your country's copyright law jurisdiction.
