# 🪶 ➜ Welcome to the **SubFAQ**
This is a child page from the main [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq/), that is not intended to discuss piracy in general, but rather to address frequently asked issues regarding how this particular subreddit functions.

# 📑 1 ➜ Taking good care of the ship's maintenance

### ❔ Will the Reddit administrators likely ban r/Piracy?
- Up until March 2019, we had been able to effectively regulate this community so that the reddit admins had no need to get in touch with us over alleged copyright violations. But things changed when the [admins of Reddit contacted us](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b28d9q/rpiracy_has_received_a_notice_of_multiple/) regarding DMCA takedowns.
- We are currently treading water and facing what appear to be excessive demands such as deleting any possibly harmful links that were posted throughout the history of this subreddit or enforcing rules for basic enquiries about websites that didn't even contain any links.

### ❔ What did the scrubbing entail?
- We have [erased all articles and comments older than September 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b4pkwp/scrubbin_the_deck/) as a preventative action to avoid being taken down as a result of historical DMCAs (*i.e. DMCA against stuff submitted years ago*), which was decided upon democratically. Even while there isn't a guarantee, nobody can say that we didn't do due diligence.
- A scrubbing script can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/db0/subredditScrubber).

# 📑 2 ➜ Keeping the main vessel afloat

### ❔ In the event that the subreddit is suspended, is there a second location where users may go?
- Definitely. In the decentralised Reddit-like platform Lemmy, we've set up a backup place. This is where it is: https://lemmy.ml/c/piracy
- A secondary fallback location is also available at: https://raddle.me/f/Piracy
- While we intend to do everything in our power to keep this subreddit alive and well, it's justified to accept that if the ship sinks, the entire crew will be unable to reunite.

### ❔ Is it a good idea to create a backup subreddit on Reddit?
- That is a logical concern. But that also implies that Reddit will continue to have some level of influence over us. But if another is made, this page will be updated.
