# üìë 1 ‚ûú General Questions

### ‚ùî How did digital piracy actually begin?
- As soon as the technology [Cut, copy, and paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste) was introduced. This made it possible to easily transmit or copy digital data. Copyright holders have been scurrying around like headless goblins trying to mend things since, but the modern ships of the sea have long since established themselves as a formidable force.

### ‚ùî Will I get in trouble if I visit a pirate website or download a certain file?
- Most issues come when copyright holders [lodge a complaint](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/faq/isp_complaints/) to your ISP (*largely due to torrenting*). Use a VPN to avoid receiving DMCA letters.
- Simply visiting the web or downloading a file normally will not pose an issue with your ISP. That being stated, use caution when using the internet. Your best line of defence will always be common sense.

### ‚ùî Which OS (*Operating System*) is the safest when it comes to piracy?
- One of the [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) qualifies as safe if you mean least likelihood of contracting a virus. However, as Windows is by far the most widely used OS worldwide, the majority of digital items that are pirated would be directed at Windows users, offering the platform the widest selection at the compromise of some privacy & security.

### ‚ùî How can I tell if what I download is safe?
- For files under 650MB, you can upload these to be scanned on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and then use [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/n62da6/how_do_you_guys_know_if_a_virus_warning_is_a/gx4whhz/) to determine if any detections are most likely real or false positives.
- Other good malware analysis sites are [Intezer Analyze](https://analyze.intezer.com/) and [Hybrid Analysis](https://hybrid-analysis.com/).
- You can also use online sandboxes such as [Any.Run](https://app.any.run/) and [Triage](https://tria.ge/).
- For files over 650MB, or if you have too many files to scan, you can use free, [on demand scanners](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/jh3s0g/virus_deleted_or_not/g9v2n1k/) alongside your real-time antivirus.

### ‚ùî What is the difference between a Public & Private Tracker?
- Public trackers do not require any registration or login and are accessible to anybody. Because public trackers are open, anybody with the address may utilise them.
- Private trackers are frequently used to refer to torrent websites where registration is required in order to download their torrents. In contrast to public trackers, these are not a free-for-all feast. You must contribute (*by uploading*) an amount equal to the sum you have taken from the tracker. A ratio method is used by private trackers to keep track of this contribution balance.

### ‚ùî How can I go to websites that my ISP has blocked?
- Change your [DNS](https://www.privacyguides.org/advanced/dns-overview/) settings. If you don't do this, you'll wind up using your ISP's default DNS, which is likely extremely slow and allows them to restrict websites for you. Here are some great [DNS choices](https://www.privacyguides.org/dns/).
- You can also consider if you actually need to visit the blocked website. Depending on the situation, it can also be a good time to explore a different option.
- Note that changing your DNS settings does not hide your IP address.

# üìë 2 ‚ûú Downloads, Torrents, & VPNs

### ‚ùî What is the difference between Direct Downloads & Torrents?
- Direct downloads are kept on the server from which you are retrieving the material. A secure browser like [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox/new/) + [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) is all you need.
- Torrents are peer-to-peer file sharing systems that need seeders (*users who have previously downloaded the file*). To begin torrenting files, a separate application is required.

### ‚ùî What exactly is a VPN and what does it do?
- VPN is an abbreviation for **virtual private network**, which is a service that secures your internet connection and online privacy. It encrypts your data by concealing your IP address, allowing you to circumvent worldwide limitations on website access while still safeguarding your true identity.
- When you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is [routed through a VPN server](https://i.postimg.cc/N0TfQ7Q0/VPN-Visual-Explanation.png) before being sent to your destination.

### ‚ùî Which free VPN service is good for torrenting?
- None. Free VPNs are more likely to collect data from you for marketing purposes, be too sluggish to use, or not enable torrent activity at all. It is advised to subscribe to a VPN service such as [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

# üìë 3 ‚ûú Morals

### ‚ùî What advantages do pirated copes have over legal copies?
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Pirated Advantages** ‚ûú Payment details & identity are not compromised. Can help save a lot of money for other purchases. You own it completely offline and may access it whenever you want. Unrestricted access to the highest quality. Develops a person's intelligence navigating the sea (*internet*).
- ‚ùå **Pirated Disadvantages** ‚ûú There is a little chance of malware if you don't know what you're doing or where to search.
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Legal Advantages** ‚ûú Although not directly benefiting oneself, it supports the creator.
- ‚ùå **Legal Disadvantages** ‚ûú Payment details & personal identification are at risk. Automated updates (*games & software*) when you aren't ready for them. Videos (*anime, movies, & shows*) of worse quality unless you pay a premium. DRM restrictions prevent offline consumption of material. Companies monitor your every step in order to display advertisements or regulate your activities.

### ‚ùî Is downloading pirated content truly wrong?
- Depending on the legal structure in your nation, but generally speaking, under human law, some would argue that it is. 
- That, however, is distinct from a person's moral principles. There are many instances where businesses use unethical techniques that deprive customers of what they want or provide them poor options, making piracy morally justifiable.
