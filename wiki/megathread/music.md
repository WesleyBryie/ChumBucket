## ► Torrents / P2P


* [rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php) [.org, .net, .nl] - Russian tracker with an extensive music catalog (any format).

* [Soulseek](http://www.slsknet.org/news/node/1) - Desktop app that connects you to a P2P network used for downloading music (any format). Unlike bittorrent, the protocol used here is direct P2P i.e. downloading and uploading is not done with multiple users simultaneously but with a single user (like downloading a file from a website). This provides more security than public trackers as there is no swarm for copyright trolls to stay in and monitor. There is no quality control here, though the chances of encountering low quality files is still quite low. For people wanting to share their libraries, soulseek is the easiest and fastest way.

## ► Private Torrent Trackers

[Introduction to private trackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/guides/private_trackers)

* **[Semi-Private]** [en.metal-tracker.com](https://en.metal-tracker.com/) - A very nice tracker for metal music.

* [jpopsuki.eu](https://jpopsuki.eu/) - Music tracker for various types of music such as Japenese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, etc

* [Redacted.ch (RED)](https://redacted.ch/) [FLAC /mp3] - Best music private tracker. One of the harder trackers to maintain ratio on. 

* [Orpheus.network](https://orpheus.network/) [FLAC/mp3] - 2nd best music private tracker, after RED. Much easier ratio economy compared to RED. In addition, there is a thread where you can request any torrent available on RED, without putting a request. This provides full access to RED without the hard economy. It is highly beneficial to have accounts on both trackers.
