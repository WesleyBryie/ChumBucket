## ► SOFTWARE

### Multi-purpose sites

Avoid the pirate bay, it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. [Skulled users are not trustworthy either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

* [torrents]  [rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/) [.org, .net, .nl] - Amazing tracker for software of all types (ie. your favorite graphics/music/video software, including plugins for them, etc.). Torrents will be checked by staff for integrity and will show [a checkmark](https://i.imgur.com/GpZIvRq.jpg) on the torrent page.

* [torrents] [theaudioscene.net](https://theaudioscene.net/) - Private tracker

* [DDL] [forum.ru-board.com > Underground](http://forum.ru-board.com/board.cgi?catplace=6) - "Underground" subforum at ru-board

* [torrents] [rarbg.to](https://rarbg.to/) - Allows no user uploads. Everything is automated to auto post scene releases, either through a combination of close ties to The Scene or simply re-uploads content from general/0-day private trackers, who themselves have close ties to The Scene. In either situation, it's one of the safest public trackers for software and games.

* [DDL] [warez-bb.org](http://warez-bb.org/) - This one is especially good for PC software. The site is down most of the time though, sadly. Has the highest number of cracked software than any other resource. For larger torrents though, it is recommended to use MOCH (multi one-click hosters) like real-debrid, or you can try the torrents first while keeping the DDL alternatives as a last resort.

[Intro to private trackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/guides/private_trackers)

* [Mac] [BrokenStones](https://brokenstones.club) - Considered to be the best private tracker for Mac apps

* [alpharatio.cc](https://alpharatio.cc/) - A general private tracker focused on scene releases. Inferior in content compared to other general trackers like IPT, TL, FL etc but has a very strong request section. Great for requests for which personalised trackers don't exist or aren't good enough. Can be joined through MAM and RED during AR's global invites period, keep an eye out

* [Filelist](https://filelist.ro/) - One of the largest general private trackers. Romanian tracker, but media content will typically include dual language audio (English and Romanian).

* [IPTorrents](http://iptorrents.com/) - The largest general private tracker
