# GAMES

Scene groups (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, etc) do not have public websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonators. Beware of these sites as they tend to package their releases with malware (2 notable exceptions are https://www.skidrowreloaded.com and https://skidrowrepacks.com/, which are fine to use).

Sites labeled repacks are for releases that have been repacked from the original scene release. Their intent is to provide pre-cracked installations as well as smaller filesizes, and in many cases, also provide DLCs included in the installation.
