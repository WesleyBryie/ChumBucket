# GAMES

Scene groups (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, etc) do not have public websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonators. Beware of these sites as they tend to package their releases with malware.

For PC games piracy news (crack releases, DRM news etc), visit /r/CrackWatch 

Sites labeled repacks are for releases that have been repacked from the original scene release. Their intent is to provide pre-cracked installations as well as smaller filesizes, and in many cases, also provide DLCs included in the installation.
