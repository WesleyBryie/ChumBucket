# GENERAL PURPOSE SITES AND SEARCH ENGINES

**Use an adblocker like uBlock Origin before visiting any of the linked sites.**

❗ General-purpose indexers to search for any type of content. If you're looking for software, it's recommended to use the [**Software Downloads**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/software_downloads) section of the wiki instead. In regards to non-software, sites like thepiratebay/limetorrents can also have fake torrents - follow these [**preliminary measures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide) to avoid accidentally running malware.

❗ **[Warning]** The below search engines / torrent aggregators will list as many publicly available torrents as possible, unfiltered and unfettered.

Never use these to search for software/games, but when searching for other media types, such as videos, take some [**preliminary measures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide) to avoid running malware.
