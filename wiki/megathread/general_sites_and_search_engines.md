# GENERAL PURPOSE SITES AND SEARCH ENGINES

General-purpose indexers to search for any type of content. If you're looking for software, it's recommended to use the [**Software Downloads**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/software_downloads) section of the wiki instead. In regards to non-software, sites like thepiratebay/limetorrents can also have fake torrents - follow these [**preliminary measures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide) to avoid accidentally running malware.

## ► **Search Engines / DHT crawlers**

These torrent search engines/DHT crawlers can be used to search within as many publicly listed torrents as possible to find rare content that may not be available in the above trackers/indexers.

❗ **[Warning]** These search engines will list as many publicly available torrents as possible, unfiltered and unfettered. This means that torrents that download malware are likely to appear in the search results. Never use these to search for software, but when searching for other media types, take some [**preliminary measures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide) to avoid running malware.
