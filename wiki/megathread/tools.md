##► Torrent Clients

Notes: uTorrent [has bundled malware \(a bitcoin miner\) into the software in the past](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). The company developing this software is not trustworthy. Bittorrent (the torrent client) is owned by the same company.

##► Download Services

> Some DDL sites may only offer downloads through premium links, meaning the download will be available through a file host which would lock the download unless you paid a subscription to said file host. The prices can be a bit extravagant, especially when you consider that many DDL sites may use different file hosts, so it would not be feasible to pay for multiple of these subscriptions.
