##► Torrent Clients

Notes: uTorrent [has bundled malware \(a bitcoin miner\) into the software in the past](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). The company developing this software is not trustworthy. Bittorrent (the torrent client) is owned by the same company.
