**Notes on software and sites to avoid:**

* Avoid the pirate bay, it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. [Skulled users are not trustworthy either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

* uTorrent [has bundled malware (a bitcoin miner) into the software in the past](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825). The company developing this software is not trustworthy. Bittorrent (the torrent client) is owned by the same company.

* [Bitlord \(torrent client\) is malware.](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1yb8kf/warning_do_not_download_bitlord_it_has_major/)

* [Soda Stream is malware.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/8q2pg3/anyone_who_can_explain_why_soda_player_is/)

* [Sidify/Allavsoft are scams - They are not able to download from spotify in any way, and instead record the streams or download from alternative platforms, like youtube.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/6l2lwh/any_experience_with_sidify/)

* Peerblock is garbage and placebo software. If you were to assume that their IP block lists are accurate, it still would not help to curb copyright complaints against you. Other peers in the swarm do not need to be connected to you in order to see your IP. Your IP will be visible regardless and if found in a torrent swarm, it's liable to be logged and reported.

## ► PRIVACY/SECURITY

As a precursor, read our entry regarding copyright infringement complaints: ["Will I get in trouble for downloading this? How does my ISP know what I download? -- All about copyright infringement complaints and what to do if you've received one and preventing further notices."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/isp_complaints)

### **VPNs** 

* Popular VPN services aggressively market themselves on Reddit. Do not subscribe to a service just because Reddit deems it popular, cheap, or because it hits the front page. You are entrusting an entity with your personal data; do your own research. Keep in mind that VPN experiences are completely anecdotal. Someone's experience with a particular VPN may vary from location, servers, operating systems, downloads speeds, etc...

* With that said, below are some resources with which you may begin your research. Most if not all popular VPNs offer trials and/or immediate refunds. Use them to your advantage in your quest to find a VPN that works best for you. Don't forget to also read their ToS!

* Beware of free VPNs if you plan on using one for online purchases or to log into websites with sensitive data. Many free VPNs are able to provide their free services because they data mine, interpose ads in searches, etc... 

* Beware of pirating VPNs. You wouldn't pirate a condom?

* [An alternative to purchasing your VPN is hosting your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/search?q=vps&restrict_sr=on). You will have much more flexibility and you can have your VPS hoster outside your country's copyright law jurisdiction.

### **Adblockers & useful extensions**

* [uBlock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock##installation) for blocking most ads and pop-ups.
* [uBlock-safari](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari) port for Safari or MacOS users.
* [Nano Defender](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector) to remove the anti-anti-adblock pop-ups.
* [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) for installing userscripts.


### **Useful userscripts**


* [AdsBypasser](https://adsbypasser.github.io/) to skip countdown ads or continue pages and prevent ad pop-up windows.
* [AntiAdware](https://github.com/HandyUserscripts/AntiAdware##readme) to avoid installing unwanted applications downloading with legitimate software (e.g. McAfee with Adobe Flash)
* [Get DLC Info From SteamDB](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=71837) automatically creates a DLC list for tools such as CreamAPI, GreenLuma and SmartSteamEmu.

## ► TORRENT CLIENTS
 * [Tixati](https://www.tixati.com/) - extremely customizable. All menus can be rearranged and color scheme can be changed completely. Many private trackers however may not permit this client to be used.
 * [Qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) - free open-sourced client. No ads and has a built-in search feature that searches popular public trackers. Consistently updated.
 * [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) - popular macOS and unix torrent client. Has windows builds as well. Extremely lightweight client.
 * [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/) - similar to qbittorrent with a different UI some may find clunky.
 * [BiglyBT](https://www.biglybt.com/) - open source, ad-free, bittorrent client.
 * [uTorrent 2.2.1 Build 25302](http://web.archive.org/web/2016*/http://download.utorrent.com/2.2.1/utorrent.exe) - If you're still set on using uTorrent, this is a stable old build of uTorrent, before it turned to crap and had malware added. It was released on May 18, 2011. Set `net.discoverable` to False in settings and disable the Web GUI to mitigate security vulnerabilities that were later discovered. You can grab the installer from the wayback machine, as it has it cached. Just navigate to a close date past the release date noted earlier. You can check which version you have downloaded by checking the file's properties, in the details tab.

### **Private torrent trackers**

  [Intro to private trackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/private_trackers)

 * [PassThePopcorn (PTP)](https://passthepopcorn.me/) - A private tracker; best source for movies, period. Can be joined by becoming Elite on RED. Though this requires a fair amount of patience as the age of account on RED needs to be at least 1 year. Refer to [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) for more info.
 * [HD-Torrents (HDT)](https://hdts.ru/) - This private tracker is great for HD movies though not as good as PTP. Specialty lies in allowing of multiple untouched material of the same movie, which helps in getting those foreign languages, different audio/video quality, or even different content in audio/videos. Slightly superior to PTP in this regard. Can be joined through RED or you can just pay for an account through their website. (Note - Only buy the account from their own website, not a 3rd party)
 * [TV Chaos UK](https://tvchaosuk.com) - Great site for UK TV content. Best joined through requesting on /r/invites (proof of ratio from other sites required). Quality lacks a bit so use it with a TV tracker like BTN to get the most of UK content
 * [Broadcast the Net (BTN)](http://broadcasthe.net/) - A private tracker; best source for TV related content, period. Currently this tracker is not recruiting anywhere but it is recommended to join PTP where BTN will recruit again in the future  
 * [TV Vault (TVV)](https://tv-vault.me/) - Best private tracker for old TV shows. Best way to join it is through MAM.  
 * [More Than TV (MTV)](https://morethan.tv/) - 2nd best private tracker for TV after BTN. Retention is not good but with a strong request section, this is not an issue. Can be joined through RED
 * [AvistaZ](https://avistaz.to/) - One of the best places for Asian (mainly Japan, South Korea, China etc) movies and TV shows. Best place for Korean dramas. Easiest way to join is through application on their site. Also one of the few top trackers that have open signups from time to time.

### Sports

 * [footybite.com](http://footybite.com/) - Live streams. Soccer
 * /r/mmafights - Yes
 * [nflbite.com](https://home.nflbite.com/) - Football
 * [sportsurge.net](https://sportsurge.net/) - Live streams. MMA, boxing, basketball, football

## ► SOFTWARE

* Avoid the pirate bay, it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. [Skulled users are not trustworthy either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

 * [rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/) (torrents) [.org, .net, .nl] - Amazing tracker for software (ie. your most desired graphics/music/video software, including plugins for them, etc.). Torrents will be checked by staff for validity.
 * [rarbg.to](https://rarbg.to/) - Allows no user uploads. Everything is automated to auto post scene releases, either through a combination of close ties to The Scene or simply re-uploads content from general/0-day private trackers, who themselves have close ties to The Scene. In either situation, it's one of the safer public trackers for software and games.
 * [warez-bb.org](http://warez-bb.org/) (DDL) - This one is especially good for PC software. The site is down most of the time though, sadly. Has the highest number of cracked software than any other resource. For larger torrents though, it is recommended to use MOCH (multi one-click hosters) like real-debrid, or you can try the torrents first while keeping the DDL alternatives as a last resort.

## ► GAMES

Scene groups (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, etc) do not have official websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonating them. Beware of these sites as they tend to package their releases with malware.

Unlike bittorrent, the protocol used here is direct P2P i.e. downloading and uploading is not done with multiple users simultaneously but with a single user (like downloading a file from a website). This provides more security than public trackers as there is no swarm for copyright trolls to stay in and monitor. Unlike other sources (except youtube), there is no quality control though the chances of encountering low quality files is still quite low. For people wanting to share their libraries, soulseek is the easiest and fastest way.

 * [rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php) [FLAC/ALAC/m4a/mp3] [.org, .net, .nl] - Russian tracker with an extensive music catalog.

 * [Redacted.ch (RED)](https://redacted.ch/) [FLAC /mp3] - Best music private tracker. [Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/private_trackers) to join. One of the harder trackers to maintain ratio on. 

 * [Orpheus.network](https://orpheus.network/) [FLAC/mp3] - 2nd best music private tracker, after RED. Much easier ratio economy compared to RED. In addition, there is a thread where you can request any torrent available on RED, without putting a request. This provides full access to RED without the hard economy. It is highly recommended to have accounts on both the trackers
 
 * [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) - command-line program to download video/audio from Youtube videos and other sites. 
  * [Youtube-dl-GUI](https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui) - GUI for youtube-dl for those not proficient in using the command line.

## ► PORN

### **Public trackers**:

 * [rarbg.to](https://rarbg.to/) - Arguably the best public tracker for porn, mainly scene releases. A lot of single seeder torrents with low speeds but you'll be able to download eventually. 

### **Private trackers**:

 * [pornolab.net (PL)](https://pornolab.net/) - An always open private tracker and the best out there if going by the sheer amount of porn available here, from studio professional to amateur stuff. 

 * [empornium.me (EMP)](https://empornium.me/) - Has much lower content overall compoared to PL but the biggest strengths are the request section and the amount of amateur content - both better than PL. Also has other pornographic content like magazines, games, books, comics etc. Can be joined by becoming power user on RED.

### **Premium Links from file hosts**

Some DDL sites may only offer downloads through premium links, meaning the download will be available through a file host which would lock the download unless you paid a subscription to said file host. The prices can be a bit extravagant, especially when you consider that many DDL sites may use different file hosts, so it would not be feasible to pay for multiple of these subscriptions.

To get around this, you can try [free premium leech generators](https://filehostlist.miraheze.org/wiki/Free_Premium_Leeches) or pay for a debrid service, such as real debrid, premiumize, all debrid, etc. which supports downloading from a large list of file hosts, torrents, etc. as an alternative. They essentially act as a middleman, meaning they download the file for you (an automated process), then you download from them. Services like these can be as cheap as 3 USD a month, which can be considered a good tradeoff given the large amount of file hosts they offer downloading from, compared to file host subscription each costing upwards of 10 USD a month.
